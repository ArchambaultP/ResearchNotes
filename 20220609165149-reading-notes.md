# A robot-based intelligent management design for agricultural cyber-physical systems

Paper proposes a robot-based system that can intelligently manage the opening growth environments of crops. A binarized neural network (BNN) hardware module provides real-time detection of target crops, while cryptographic hardware functions ensure security of sensor data. The robot can dynamically update its cryptographic hardware functions to respond to the system's evolving needs.

Targeted fruit is the dragon fruit.

Experiments show that they can increase the speed of cryptographic function computing by ~99.5%, while BNN inference can accelerate by a factor of 13359.

FPGA's respond to CPS problems, such as real-time requirements, adaptability, and scalability.

Current data collection techniques do not fulfill our needs (i.e. a picture of a crop only represents one side). The alternative to growing sensors and generated data is to harness to mobility of robots to interact with sensors. This could help robot associate data with crops, along with letting the robot target specific crops if additional data is needed.

Advances in ACPS have involved either developing sensing architectures or detection applications. The computing architecture design has been neglected. This results in restricted system adaptivity, performance, and automation.

Proposed robot acts as a data mule (collector), and interacts directly with the system. When robot collects data, the data from sensor is encrypted and sent to robot. From sensor and Weather data, the robot can decide actuator control.

Proposed robot also contains a high performance computing architecture (FPGA)

Robot is adaptable through hardware virtualization techniques and dynamic cryptographic functions. This is also known as the "partial reconfiguration technique"

Table 1 compares various different agricultural robot designs

Robot vision task is based on a Deep Neural Network circuit (DNN). Because of memory and processing requirements of FPGA's, DNN are not suited. BNN, a binary simplification of DNN fits those requirements

BNN:
    input: 32x32x3 8-bit RGB image
    output: 16 bit results, 10 classification categories
    
Fig 4. Details their layered and virtualizable design which provides system adaptability and scalability

Fig 5. Details their Layered ACPS design with 4 layers
    * Interaction
    * Control
    * Application → first 3 mainly live inside robot design
    * Physical → interacts with real world

The control layer realizes the decision-making mechanism of the cyber-physical interaction. Currently, this mechanism contains a **crop growth model** (Root zone soil moisture deficit) and a **detection model of pests and diseases** (CV heuristic)

Based on control layer design, adaptative services are assigned different priorities. Ex: to ensure health of plants, detection model of pests has priority over crop growth model

Robot interacts with actuators through WIFI. Bluetooth beacons let us triangulate and locate, along with gps data, the position of the robot.

## Takeaways
    Including FPGA within robot architecture drastically improves performance
    Adaptability of systems may come through hardware and layered virtualization
    There needs to be a priority mechanism between plant model and farm operations model
    Security can be achieved through encoded sensor data

abstract = {This work proposes a robot-based intelligent management design that can intelligently manage the opening growth environments of crops. Different from the most existing agricultural robots, the FPGA device is used as the computing architecture of the proposed robot. In this robot design, a binarized neural network (BNN) hardware module provides the real-time and accurate detection of target crops, while cryptographic hardware functions ensure the security of sensor data transfers in an unsupervised environment. Based on a layered and virtualizable design method, the robot can not only control the actuators to maintain the ideal growth environment of crops but also dynamically adapt its cryptographic hardware functions to meet different requirements. Experiments show that, compared to the conventional microprocessor-based architecture, in this proposed robot, the processing time of cryptographic functions can be reduced by 99.46% to 99.62%, while the BNN inference can accelerate by a factor of 13,359.6 on average. To support all the AES, DESand 3DES functions, through system adaptivity, the robot design can reduce 37.4% of slice LUTs and 29.81% of slice registers in a Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020 device, while it can result in a power reduction of 13.6%.}
