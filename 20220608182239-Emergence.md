# Emergence
**Important**: There exists many definitions for emergence.

The idea: there is an external observer who is able to determine and analyse the phenomena produced by a process.

in [[20220608171938]] emergence is split in 3:

### Nominal Emergence
Linked to the presence of macroscopic properties which can not be defined as microscopic

### Weak Emergence
Sub-part of nominal emergence, where appearance of phenomena cannot be explained easily.

This type of emergence requires simulations and experiments to study

### Strong Emergence
Opposed to nominal emergence, considers that the observed phenomena at a macroscopic point of view has side effects on both microscopic and macroscopic levels.
