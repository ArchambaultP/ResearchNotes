# Bio-Cyber-Physical System Design

Designing a BCPS requires studying the nature of the relationships between elements of the system, in order to understand the BCPS as a whole.

In this integrative point of view, the CPS part of the system should be designed considering the biological nature and its constraints.

## System Characteristics
BCP systems are characterized by these 4 properties:
* [[20220608182239]] 20220608182239-Emergence
* [[20220608180245]] 20220608180245-Complexity
* [[20220608162801]] 20220608162801-Interactions
* A **symbiotic coupling** between the bio, cyber, and physical parts that involve bi-directional interactions from the Biological part to the technical part. [[20220609142839]]

## Isomorphic Framework

As mentioned in [[20220608153138]] Fig 2., we can use an isomorphic framework for modelling BCPS. This model defines 3 axes:

* Structural Elements
* Shape
* Dynamics

Each couple of axes describe a specification plan:

- Structure & Shape: system architecture
- Structure & Dynamics: Evolution on physical, logical, and biological levels.
- Shape & Dynamics: Behavior

Self-organization property of CPS are tied to the structure of the system.

Emergence of properties/functions is tied to the dynamics of the system.

## Time representation
The time representation of the system will change according to its nature

- Physical: continuous
- Cyber: Discrete / Event Based
- Biological: Continuous (functional level), Discrete (Structural level)

## Engineering Flow

1. Conception phase
   * aims to provide behavioral description of whole system and specifies the behavioral space (e.g. position of artifact within the human body)
   * In the isomorphic framework This corresponds to the Shape & Dynamics plane
 2. Modeling Phase
    * Consider this an instantiation of the concept.
    * Aims to define the system architecture and the nature of interactions of the system
    * In the isomorphic framework, this corresponds to the Structure & Shape plane
 3. Evaluation Phase
    * The formal specs have been prototyped and we can evaluate the system through model-checking, use-case valudation, experiments, etc.
    * The evaluation leads to an estimation of the operational parameters of the system (stability, resource consumption, etc.)
    * In the isomorphic framework, this is the Structure & Dynamics plane
    * We repeat evaluation to refine model until system is deemed worthy of operations
