# Bio-Cyber-Physical System Design

Designing a BCPS requires studying the nature of the relationships between elements of the system, in order to understand the BCPS as a whole.

In this integrative point of view, the CPS part of the system should be designed considering the biological nature and its constraints.

## Isomorphic Framework

As mentioned in [[20220608153138]] Fig 2., we can use an isomorphic framework for modelling BCPS. This model defines 3 axes:

* Structural Elements
* Shape
* Dynamics

Each couple of axes describe a specification plan:

- Structure & Shape: system architecture
- Structure & Dynamics: Evolution on physical, logical, and biological levels.
- Shape & Dynamics: Behavior

Self-organization property of CPS are tied to the structure of the system.

Emergence of properties/functions is tied to the dynamics of the system.

## Time representation
The time representation of the system will change according to its nature

- Physical: continuous
- Cyber: Discrete / Event Based
- Biological: Continuous (functional level), Discrete (Structural level)
