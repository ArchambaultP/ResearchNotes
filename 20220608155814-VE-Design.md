# Virtual Environments Design

As a scientific challenge, Virtual Environment (VE) design is about the conception of a
theoretical framework dedicated to human-machine integration and its modeling, from
epistemology to formal and experimental methods. As a practical challenge, VE design
is about correct design for enhancement and reliable engineering of human systems
integration, from human-machine interaction to sociotechnical system levels, their
behavior and their performances.
