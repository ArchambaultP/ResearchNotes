# Bio-Cyber-Physical Systems: from concepts to human-systems integration engineering

Paper aims to set grounds for framework helping the engineering of BCPS.

The interaction of systems is getting to complex to take a reductionist approach. we are better off trying to create the system as a whole.

HSI engineering still need a conceptual framework that ensure correctess-by-construcion and safety by design.

The domain of HSI is expanding rapidly, and with the approach of VR, Cobotics, etc. A new framework needs to be developed for their design.

Paper characterizes BCPS by:
* Complexity
* Emergence
* Interactions
* Symbiotic Coupling between Bio, cyber, and physical systems.

Paper presents the isomorphic design framework for BCPS

Aspects of successful systems:
   * holistically and concurrently discovering stakeholder needs
   * explore opportunities
   * document requirements
   * synthesize, verify, validate, deploy, maintain and evolve solutions
   * Considers the complete problem as a whole, from system concept exploration through system disposal
 
To satisfy the above, it becomes important to model the problem in a holistic approach to fully understand the system.

Requirements engineering is the key to describe the system of interest and propose methodologies for its development. It represents the link between domain experts.

Different types of requirements need to be understood, from functional to non-functional requirements

non-functional requirements can be subdivided into qualities such as efficiency, reliability, portability, maintainability, usability, and boundary conditions.

boundary conditions are further developed into environmental, operational, development, regulatory, and ethical requirements.

Current advances in BCPS have mostly considered the human integration within the cyber system. The inverse relation, i.e. how the cyber system affects the human, has often been neglected. This is why we need an holistic approach.

Figure 4. Shows a very solid BCP engineering process flow.

1. Conception phase
   * aims to provide behavioral description of whole system and specifies the behavioral space (e.g. position of artifact within the human body)
   * In the isomorphic framework [[20220608165927]], this corresponds to the Shape & Dynamics plane
 2. Modeling Phase
    * Consider this an instantiation of the concept.
    * aims to define the system architecture and the nature of interactions of the system
    * In the isomorphic framework, this corresponds to the Structure & Shape plane
 3. Evaluation Phase
    * The formal specs have been prototyped and we can evaluate the system through model-checking, use-case valudation, experiments, etc.
    * The evaluation leads to an estimation of the operational parameters of the system (stability, resource consumption)
    * We repeat evaluation to refine model until system is deemed worthy of operations

abstract = {Abstract Engineering a technical system that must be coupled to humans is generally a tough task. One of the main reasons is that two systems, different by nature, must be coupled. Even if, there has been a strong effort to include Human factors in engineering processes, there is still a lot of issues to tackle with. Indeed, the adaptation of technical centered engineering processes to human concerns is not necessary the best solution. The Human-machine design process requires then to consider the system as a whole and not as a composition of heterogenous elements. This is the key towards efficient and adaptative systems. The goal of the paper is both a conceptual and theoretical effort to ground Human-Systems Integration as a discipline\_and to propose a framework aimed at helping the engineering of Bio-Cyber-Physical Systems (Bio-CPS).},
