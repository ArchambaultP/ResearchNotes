## Title
Virtual Environments Integrative
Design â€“ From Human-in-the-Loop
to Bio-Cyber-Physical Systems

## Notes
The arrival of sensors/physical data caused a need to rethink the design/engineering of human/machine systems from an integrative point of view.

Paper aims to develop new solution for human system integration(HIS) that move away from the Human-in-the-loop (HITL) model.

Issues Observed:
* "The development of new interactive systems involves the necessity to develop theoretical basis for designing Bio-CPS"
* Hierarchy of systems, from biological cell level to physical to cyber, makes interoperability hard to design.
* This system of systems is highly variable and deals with complex dynamics, which requires a strong validation framework along with time to experiment, domain knowledge, integration testing, etc.

The problem with HITL design is that it cannot model a fully integrated system of systems in time & space.

Design of advanced BCPS requires a new modeling approach.

A more complex model can be beneficial in certain domains, like biology.

CPS evaluation is related to adaptability and evolution of system with physical part (i.e. scalability), not just real time response of input

HITL classical systems design approach is grounded on a fundamental epistemological error: We use a reductionist approach to model nature, and we assume symmetry in our interactions

Bio-physical systems do not always contain symmetrical interactions

two factors limit Human systems integration:
    * misunderstanding of autonomy of a living system
    * underestimation of interaction and integration as a biological process
 
 We need to shift from a reductive, interactive point of view to a integrative point of view putting the complex nature of whole system as primary element
 
 BCPS Applications include:
 
 - Gesture Training/Rehab
 - assisted surgery
 - functional reeducation
 - advanced MOOC

abstract="The use of technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) is more and more widespread in our everyday life and is now mature enough to be used in critical medical or aerospace applications. The main issue is then to provide more adaptive abilities to VR/AR applications in developing them using human concerns as primary element. To that way, beyond the classical HITL concept this paper proposes an integrative point of view for virtual environment design based on the concept of Bio-CPS. The goal of this paper is to present Bio-CPS related concepts and to sketch some guidelines for future virtual environments design focusing on specific application fields.",
