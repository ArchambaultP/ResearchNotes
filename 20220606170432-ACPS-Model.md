## Processes involved within an ACPS

To model an ACPS with my current understanding, we need many parts:
   
  * A growth dynamics model (analytical)
  * A physical model of the environment (analytical ?)
  * A computational model for our regulation strategy (optimization at the end of simulation chain)
  * An interaction submodel between the Physical world and the Computational world. This model either discretizes a biological process (phys->comp), or converts computed amount into their real equivalent (comp->phys)

TODO: Atomicize above bullet-points, add Zettel about each above model.
