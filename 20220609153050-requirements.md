# Requirements engineering

Requirements engineering defines the link between domain experts through formal specifications of a system in order to propose methodologies for its development.

## Types of Requirements

There are two types of requirements: 
* **Functional** requirements describe functions or services that must be realized by the system or that are not allowed
* **Non-functional** requirements describe qualitative factors of a system. These can be subdivided into qualities and boundary conditions.

####  Qualities

* Efficiency
* Reliability
* Portability
* Maintainability
* Usability

### Boundary Conditions

* Environmental Requirements
* Operational Requirements
* Development Requirements
* Regulatory Requirements
* Ethical Requirements
