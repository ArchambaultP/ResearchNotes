## Ongoing problems in ACPS

Regulation of physical environment (soil water content, soil nutrient composition, etc.) is not precise enough to track plant growth dynamically through our current methods, i.e. a mix of field experimentation and automation.

To remedy this, we need to involve a continuous dynamic biological process to properly simulate our environment regulation strategy. This will be some analytical / mathematical process, as growth dynamics cannot be perceived by sensors. Additional care needs to be taken in order to intake "crop growth information" within our model. (Needs more detail)
