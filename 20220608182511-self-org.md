# Self-Organization
Self-Organization is a dynamical and adaptive process allowing the system to obtain or maintain an organizational structure without external intervention.

The self-organization of a system is linked to an increase in the order of the system, or to a decrease in its entropy, without any external control.

This concept is relevant for interactive systems, but is inadequate for describing physical systems behaviour.
