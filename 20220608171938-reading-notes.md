## Title
Towards a Theory for Bio - Cyber Physical Systems
Modelling

## Notes
gist: HITL is a reductionist approach to BCPS modelling which exhibits limiations due to the different natures of the systems involved. The paper proposes an integrative approach to modeling BCPS based on integrating computational elements to biological systems, and the key concept of human systems integration

Reductionism (mechanization and computerization of biological entity) in HITL is not suited for bcps systems design.

Designing a BCPS is even harder than a CPS. Along with CPS issues like relationship between time-scales (continuous physical process VS discrete computational), we also need to link the difference in nature of interactions between system components within their relative scale. (I.e. physics has mostly local and direct interaction, whereas biology has non-local and indirect interactions)

Difficulties arise because when we design a BCPS, complexity can be good, whereas we want to avoid complexity when designing a CPS. How can we couple such systems to perform a common task with a high level of confidence ?

Paper suggests that approaches in parallel computing, distributed computing, and multi-agent systems are well adapted to CPS issues

Defining a system as complex goes against the reductionist approach, as that approach assumes we can reduce a complex system to an arbitrary composition of principles.

Emergence and self organization are complementary.

self-organization and emergence are system properties resulting from interaction between cyber and physical parts of the system.

The nature of interaction between human and system should be questioned:
    - Are we talking about an _interaction_ or a _coupling_ between 2 systems ?
    - Even within the same physical space, two systems may differ in their structural and dynamic organization.
 
"So the Bio-CPS modeling needs bio-compatible and bio-integrable CPS design and engineering scientific grounding."
=> Need to design system at an organization level higher than the biological body.

biological interactions are functional.

Three different interaction natures and time representation make BCPS very hard to design, and make HITL improper for the task.
