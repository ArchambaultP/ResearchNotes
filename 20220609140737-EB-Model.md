# Event-B Modeling

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modeling and analysis using set theory.

The model expresses state properties (invariants) that define the possible set of states of the model.

A state is a mapping relating each variable to a given value. The domain of each variable can either be left to programmatic type, or to a predetermined set.

Interactions between states are modeled through a predetermined list of events that represent every possible interaction.

The model is discrete, as such only one event can be fired at any one time. Due to this, the model does not describe any fairness or liveness property.

Model validation is done either through predicate calculus, or through abstract type checking (e.g. Haskell)
