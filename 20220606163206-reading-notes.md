## Title

Precision Regulation Model of Water  
and Fertilizer for Alfalfa Based on  
Agriculture Cyber-Physical System

## Notes
- regulation of water/nutrient not precise enough to track alfalfa growth dynamically
    - Current methods (field exp/automation) cannot dynamically track growth, so inprecise water/nutrient regulation
- Paper proposes a water/nutrient regularization based on agriculture cyber-physical system (ACPS)
    - "ACPS is the cyber-physical system (CPS) as designed and applied to agriculture"
    - "an ACPS enhances the ability of agricultural systems to engage in real-time communication, precise regulation and self-coordination through the deeper integration of computation with physical processes"
- Processes involved
    - Alfalfa growth (biological process)
    - Changes in soil moisture/fertilizer (physical process)
    - Regularization Strategy (discrete computational process)
- Proposed model (PRMWFA-ACPS) consists of 
    * Biophysical submodel of Alfalfa
        - Alfalfa Dynamic model (continuous dynamic sim process) [22,31,32]
        - Water Balance Model
        - Nitrogen Balance Model [30,37]
        - Alfalfa BioPhys Model (outputs yield)
     * Computational Submodel (discrete)
        - Computes deficit in water/nutrient
     * Cyber-Physical Interaction Submodel
        - Interaction from Phys to Cyber or vice-versa
        - phys->comp: completes sampling function, can discretize bio process
        - comp->phys: Completes and converts data to physical quantity
- Growth dynamics cannot be perceived by sensing
- Most studies on simulating growth environment ignored crop growth information( proper to plant) in physical environment

In this paper, we propose a precision regulation model of water and fertilizer for alfalfa based on agriculture cyber-physical system (ACPS) for irrigation and fertilizer management in alfalfa (PRMWFA-ACPS). The proposed PRMWFA-ACPS is a comprehensive model that includes the biophysical submodel, the computation submodel of water and fertilizer regulation, and the interaction of the submodels for both. The proposed model interacts with the alfalfa growth and its physical environment along with the irrigation strategy to improve the precise regulation of water and fertilizer. To verify the performance of the proposed model, we develop a simulation platform for PRMWFA-ACPS based on Ptolemy. Through physical experiments performed in the field at the Ningxia irrigation area of the Yellow River over three years (2016-2018), we verified and analyzed PRMWFA-ACPS by comparing the simulated and measured values, such as the growth period, leaf area index, soil water content and alfalfa yield. The experimental results show that the mean relative error of the growth period simulated by the model is between 1.9% and 6.8%, the mean relative error of the leaf area index simulated by the model is between 2.1% and 9.8%, the mean relative error of the soil water content simulated by the model is between 4.3% and 12.8%, and the mean relative error of the yield simulated by the model is between 1.2% and 14.3%. These findings indicate that PRMWFA-ACPS has promising applicability to the Ningxia irrigation area of the Yellow River and improves the accurate regulation of water and fertilizer application to alfalfa in a complex physical environment.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975672},  ISSN={2169-3536},  month={},}
