"CPS are systems with deep integrations of computational ele-
ments with physical processes "

## Long definition

A Cyber-Physical system is a deep intricate system made of both physical and computation elements. They can be seen as an extension of embedded systems, where the interactions between physical and cyber can be reduced to a simple bidirectional data exchange.

The number of interactions within a CPS cannot be reduced to a bidirectional data exchange, as the dynamic behavior of components affect the system in non-linear ways . In other words, emerging phenomena can occur [[20220608182239]].

This emergence makes the system non-deterministic, thus unpredictable.

The efficiency of the "cyber" part is not linked to time response (as in embedded systems), but to the adaptability of the response to the physical part. As such, time becomes a semantic property common to both physical and cyber.

More quality measurements involve reliability, robustness, predicatbility, accuracy, and repeatability.
