# Interactions

An interaction can be defined as a dynamical relationship between several elements using a set of actions that can be reciprocal or not.

An interaction can be local or non-local, direct or indirect.

## Local / Non-Local

An interaction is local when its effects can be observed within a short distance between elements.

Ex: spring-damper mechanism

The interaction is non-local when it cannot be observed or there is no apparent link between elements.

Ex: exchange between organs in humans, Aharonov-Bohm effect, quantum entanglement

## Direct / Indirect

An interaction is direct if the actions of the related elements have a direct influence on their neighbours 

Ex: particle collision

The interaction is indirect when actions have to go through a medium to affect the related elements.

Ex: data transmission in network, pheromones in ants.

## Symmetry

An interaction is symmetrical when there is a reciprocity between the elements involved

Ex: gravitational attraction, push/pull forces
