# Interactions

An interaction can be defined as a dynamical relationship between several elements using a set of actions that can be reciprocal or not.

An interaction can be local or non-local, direct or indirect.

Human systems integration is achieved by a combination of three classes of interactions ]⍦, ƛ, φ[:
* Logical (ƛ)
* Physical (φ)
* functional (physiological) (⍦) [[20220608185901]]

## Class Intersections

* ]ƛ, ⍦[ defines the anthropological and cognitive interface domain
* ]φ, ⍦[ defines the physical ergonomics and bio-mechanical domain
* ]ƛ, φ[ defines the automatic control and embedded systems domain

## Interaction Properties

### Local / Non-Local

An interaction is local when its effects can be observed within a short distance between elements.

Ex: spring-damper mechanism

The interaction is non-local when it cannot be observed or there is no apparent link between elements.

Ex: exchange between organs in humans, Aharonov-Bohm effect, quantum entanglement

### Direct / Indirect

An interaction is direct if the actions of the related elements have a direct influence on their neighbours 

Ex: particle collision

The interaction is indirect when actions have to go through a medium to affect the related elements.

Ex: data transmission in network, pheromones in ants.

### Symmetry

An interaction is symmetrical when there is a reciprocity between the elements involved

Ex: gravitational attraction, push/pull forces
