# Human-In-The-Loop
Current methods and tools of virtual environments design and human-machine inter-
action engineering are derived from cybernetics, automation, computer science, cog-
nitive sciences and human factors. According that classical paradigm, virtual
environments (VR and AR) are modeled as “human-in-the-loop” systems, in which a
human is interacting with a less or more immersive cyber-physical system. It models
the system using a technical approach, describing interaction links and interfaces as a
physical or computational process. In this paradigm, interactions are considered as a
process of communication between components of the system reduced to each other in
symmetric loops “input, information processing, output”.
