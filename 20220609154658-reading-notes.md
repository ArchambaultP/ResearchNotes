# Integrative Approach to Understand Vulnerabilities and Enhance the Security of Cyber-Bio-Cognitive-Physical Systems

## Notes

Study of security of CPS is a recent research field, whereas the dependencies of live organisms coupled with sensors and electronics, perception, and cognition have not been studied.

Paper outlines the vulnerabilities of five cyberspace domains, then presents some advances in cross-domain understanding of those vulnerabilities.

The increased number of sensors and interactive systems mean that our current security experience is insufficient to propose robust security solutions for systems. We need to develop an understanding of vulnerabilities present within the cyber space.

five domains overview:
* Communications and information systems (CIS) and networks
    * Still prone to attacks; Ex: US defense project for developing hardware design tools to provide built-in cyber security against computer hardware vulnerabilities in military and commercial electronics systems.
* CPS
    * Prone to attacks; Ex: pipeline attacks, IEEE committee on CPS
* Bio-integrated systems (BCPS)
    * Prone to attacks: Ex: attack on pacemaker to control heart pump, diabetes insulin systems
    * We need to understand the dependence between the biological part and the physical part of the system
* Cognitive processes (decision making)
    * Social medias and the spread of fake news allow propaganda to work to affect target's perceptions
    * ^ component of _hybrid warfare_
    * AR/VR are increasingly getting better
* Drones, remotely operated or autonomous
    * Cybersecurity was not a concern in the early design phase of autonomous drones, thus are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Both Military and civilian drones.
    * Reliance on AI leads to a new, relatively unexplored vector of attack

Advances in cross-domain understanding if vulnerabilities:

* BCPS
    * Team at Berkeley design technology that restore sensory, motor, and cognitive functions in disabled people. Apparently they achieve "security, privacy, usability, and resilience in complex networks" (Sastry, 2015)
    * The rise of implantable devices make this field very important for the future
    
 * Cyber-Cognitive-Physical Systems
     * Not many studies exist on the vulnerabilities of such systems, and they do not holistically capture vulnerabilities.
     * Ex systems: Disaster-management systems, IoT smart-city projects, etc.
  
  * AI and cognitive Processes
      * Progress has been made regarding social and ethical aspects, but we need to explore the realm of new attacks that are possible.
      * AI has automated most known attack tactics, and attackers can leverage AI to create better attacks (e.g. using NLP to create good spam emails)
      * Cambridge Analytica demonstrated the power of big data

To properly understand vulnerabilities of Cyber-bio-cognitive-physical systems, we need expert knowledge in these areas:

* Analysis: analyze impact of vulnerabilities and their consequences, vectors, means and tactics of attacks, downstream impacts, potential attackers,establish security benchmarks and best practices.
* Design: design of product, systems and services with full integration of cybersecurity concepts
* Testing and Certification of components, systems, integration and interactions
* Competencies: determining competence requirements, elaborating coursework/formation, training/cert requirements, certified personel.
* Strategy&Policy: defining missions, roles and responabilities, risk-informed decision making on financing, budgeting, etc.

There is a need to bridge the gap between multiple domain experts. I.e. we need to design system from a multi-disciplinary approach, using cross-domain frameworks if possible.

The study of security is becoming an increasingly multi-disciplinary field, whereas an individual researcher will need knowledge in many, many areas involving "law, international relations, history, political science, public
administration, ethics, psychology, operations, doctrine, management, technologies, industrial base, etc."
