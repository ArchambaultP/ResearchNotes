# System Complexity


"A complex system can be defined as a set of a huge number of interacting entities, the global behaviour of which cannot be predicted by calculations or by an external observer. [...] The evolution of the system is also unpredictable. [...] Thus a system is said as complex if the [result] can only be predicted by experiments and simulations even with total knowledge of all its components and the rules that gather them."[[20220608171938]]

In other words:

- a system is **complicated** if time and talent are required to understand it well. The system organization is deterministic and computable
    - System components are fixed in time and space as system evolves

- a system is **complex** if the system is built in such a way that makes the study of its separate individual components impossible. Even if some part of a complex system could be computable, it is mainly non-deterministic and unpredictable
    - System components vary dynamically as system evolves

Complex nature of systems lead to two concepts: emergence and self organizing ability.
