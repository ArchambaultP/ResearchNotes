# Bio-compatible cyber-physical system for cloud-based customizable sensor monitoring of pressure conditions

## Notes

Paper studies a new design, implementation, and validation of a BCPS for the monitoring of stomatognathic system functioning. The system comprises a platform built on cloud web services (MoSSy) for cognitive decision making based on processing of WIFI signals and sensor data for the treament of muscular-skeletal disorders.

Sensor environment evaluated in terms of:
* performance
* cost
* robustness
* long term reliability
* suitability to environment (oral cavity in this case)

Wireless Sensor Technologies (WST) including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are shaping the current sensor environment.

RFID devices have no cooperative abilities, whereas WST devices can work within different network topologies, or communicate with multi-hops

Advances in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) had led to our increased capacity to create complex and small sensors. Further, the lack of wires with WST let us capture data we could not when wires are involved.

WST allows MEMS to be integrated in radio units to form "motes". Those motes allow the system to capture not only sensor data, but relative sensor data between motes.

Challenges in integrating WST  with bio technologies involve the need for proper power management (with no wires, we need to power the sensors). The lack of big power also reduces our computational capacity.

Biomedical sensors need to be biocompatible, which is a challenge as shape and size of biomaterial may affect sensor performance.

Biomedical sensors also need to be designed as a long lasting instrument, which greatly complexifies system analysis and design.

In certain cases, sensors may also need to be approved by regulators.

Battery life, reliability of measurements, and performance in real environments are critical issues that need to be improved for WSN. Data should be preprocessed close to source.


Applications of WSN:
* flood prediction
* climate prediction in remote locations
* fire detection
* livestock tracking (e.g. temperature)
* Food-Chain Traceability
* canned food sterilization
* Clinical Decision Support (CDS) System
* Pressure monitoring
* Long-Term data collection (to help diagnoses)

Paper points to origin of term CPS

Rest of paper investigates the role of cloud computing and CPS when building a CDS system (not very relevant to current research)

## Takeaways
BCPS design is a multi-disciplinary activity requiring multiple domain experts

CPS are well suited for smarter monitoring and control applications

Cloud computing plays a significant role in building a common knowledge base to create a robust decision making system.

"Cloud computing is one of those technologies that can
greatly benefit the world of healthcare as soon as it is
implemented."
