# Modelling bio-compatible and bio-integrative medical devices


## Notes

Paper proposes a taxonomy of medical human machine systems and define classes of applications. Drives the point home that we need to rethink the way we currently design systems in order to think about bio integration and human systems integration.

* Design, testing, validation and authority approval are becoming increasingly expensive for medical device manufacturers.
* Reliability (resistance to failure) and security (resistance to attacks) are two main concerns that need to be approached
* Design should include human integration thinking, in order to capture the biological side
* Paper shows example of adding bio-compatibility and bio-integration to Event-B-based methodology for pacemaker systems.

* Three types of medical systems:
    * Permanently implanted in patient
    * Permanent but not implanted in patient
    * Temporary and implanted in patient

Design of Correct By Construction Medical Devices

    1. Informal Requirement
    2. Formal Specification
    3. Model Verification
    4. Model Validation -[Model review]-> 2
    5. Real-time Animation -[Domain Expert Feedback]-> 2
        * animation is a useful tool to convey model perf to domain experts
    6. Trustable Formal Model

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis using set theory.

Event-B model expresses a state property (invariant) which defines the set of possible states of the model.

Event-B models have variables and state variables that are modified by a finite list of events that represent the possible interactions between modifications.

Event-B Only one event can be observed at any time. Discrete, does not describe fairness or liveness property.

Event-B validates invariant using Predicate calculus or type validation

The above Event-B fail to capture bio-compatibility and integration

Heart starts pumping in coop with the pacemaker: questions of bio-integration and compatibility

To solve the two bio problems, we use the isomorphic framework [[20220608165927]]
