# Wireless Sensor Technologies (WST)

Wireless sensor technologies include (mainly) two types of sensors: **RFID** and **Wireless Sensor Networks** (WSN)

## RFID
RFID sensors are simple sensors with no cooperative abilities. They allow us to identify sensors, thus connect to specific ones, as well as tag the incoming data.

## Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
WSN Sensors are functionally similar to RFID, but with two added features.
    1. They can talk to each other through multi-hopping
    2. They understand and can work within different network topologies

This wirelessness property also lets us build sensors that would not be possible otherwise.

## Challenges in WSN Bio-Integration
The lack of cables mean that we also have more limited power available. This is a challenge for sensor-sensitive applications, as they cannot simply stop collecting data.

This lack of power also reduces our computational capacity.

## Applications of WSN
Per [[20220609174956]]:
    * flood prediction
    * climate prediction in remote locations
    * fire detection
    * livestock tracking (e.g. temperature)
    * Food-Chain Traceability
    * canned food sterilization
    * Clinical Decision Support (CDS) System
    * Pressure monitoring
    * Long-Term data collection (to help diagnoses)
